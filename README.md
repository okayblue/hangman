# hangman

Command line version of Hangman for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman).  

The most notable part of this project is that it was my first time implementing save/load functionality using serialaization.

The dictionary is from google-10000-english-no-swears.txt.
